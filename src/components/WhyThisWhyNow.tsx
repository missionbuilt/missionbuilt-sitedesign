                  In a world of endless frameworks and methodologies, we've lost sight of what matters most â€” the mission. 
                  Product teams today are overwhelmed with processes but underwhelmed with purpose.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Powerlifting teaches us that despite endless variations of programs and techniques, 
                  the fundamentals never change: consistency, progressive overload, and recovery. 
                  These same principles apply to product leadership.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  This book exists because too many teams are chasing trends instead of truth. Too many 
                  products optimize for features instead of outcomes. We need a return to first principles.

                <p>
                  We're at an inflection point for product teams. AI is changing how we build. Remote work 
                  is changing how we collaborate. Market pressures are shortening timelines while raising expectations.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Just as a lifter must adapt their training to their changing body, product leaders must 
                  adapt to this new environment without abandoning core principles. But how?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Now is the time for clarity and conviction. For a philosophy of product leadership that transcends 
                  trends and tools. For a return to what actually moves the needle: deep user empathy, 
                  disciplined execution, and the courage to optimize for long-term impact.
