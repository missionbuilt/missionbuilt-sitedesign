# Mission Before Metrics

In the world of business and technology, we often get caught up in the numbers. Metrics, KPIs, conversion rates, and growth percentages dominate our conversations and decision-making processes. But what if I told you that the most successful organizations—the ones that truly make a lasting impact—start with something else entirely?

## The Problem with Metrics-First Thinking

When we lead with metrics, we often lose sight of the human element that makes our work meaningful. We optimize for numbers without understanding the deeper purpose behind what we're trying to achieve.

## Starting with Mission

Your mission is your North Star. It's the reason you get up in the morning, the problem you're passionate about solving, and the impact you want to make in the world.

## Finding Your Mission

To discover your true mission, ask yourself:

- What problem keeps you up at night?
- What change do you want to see in the world?
- What would you work on even if you weren't paid for it?

## Building Mission-Driven Organizations

Once you have clarity on your mission, everything else—including metrics—becomes a tool to help you achieve that greater purpose.

> "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." - Ernest Hemingway

This principle applies to mission-driven work as well. Trust in your mission, and let it guide your decisions.

## Conclusion

Remember: metrics are important, but they should serve your mission, not the other way around. Start with why, and the how will follow.
