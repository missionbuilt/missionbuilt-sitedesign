    title: "Strong Feedback, Strong Foundations",
    content: `<p>We should strive for feedback that's constructive — not combative.</p>
    
    <p>I've learned this over the course of my career. As a passionate product leader, I've had to walk a line: How do you bring intensity without intimidation? How do you make sure your excitement doesn't land as insult?</p>
    
    <p>It's not always easy. Passion can blur the edges. And in fast-moving teams, feedback can come fast and hot — even when it's meant to help.</p>
    
    <p>But here's what I've come to believe:</p>
    
    <blockquote>When feedback is anchored in empathy and structured around the mission, it becomes a lift — not a weight. It pushes people forward instead of pinning them down.</blockquote>
    
    <p>These lessons apply well beyond product, and well beyond management. They show up in how we coach our teammates, how we parent, how we partner, how we grow.</p>
    
    <p>If something matters enough to say out loud, then it matters enough to deliver with care.</p>
    
    <p>Because what you say is only part of it.</p>
    
    <p>How it lands — that's what makes it real.</p>
    
    <h3>Strong Feedback Is Often Micro</h3>
    
    <p>We tend to think feedback has to be a big moment. A review. A reset. A speech.</p>
    
    <p>But most of the feedback that actually changes people — and changes outcomes — is micro.</p>
    
    <p>One cue, one adjustment, one rep at a time.</p>
    
    <p>That's how coaching works on the platform. That's how great PMs guide a team. That's how trust is built — and how performance gets better.</p>
    
    <p>In the gym, the best feedback is short and specific: "Brace before the pull." "You're losing tension at the bottom." You don't wait until after the meet to say it — you say it in the warm-up room, in the moment, when it counts.</p>
    
    <p>In product, it's the same. "This feature's drifting from the core user need — let's tighten it." "That's a great insight — let's surface that earlier in the deck."</p>
    
    <p>Micro feedback avoids defensiveness. It's less likely to be taken personally.</p>
    
    <p>It's just the next rep, done better.</p>
    
    <h3>Share Early, Improve Always</h3>
    
    <p>Too many teams wait too long.</p>
    
    <p>They polish. They perfect. They fear showing something unfinished. But by the time the feedback comes, the team is too attached — or too far gone — to adapt.</p>
    
    <p>The best teams share early.</p>
    
    <blockquote>That's the Medici principle: seek feedback while ideas are still flexible — not fixed. Let people shape the work before it's locked in.</blockquote>`
