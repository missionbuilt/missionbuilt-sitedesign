      content: `<p>Every great lift starts with the right foundation. Your feet planted firmly on the ground, your core engaged, your mind focused on the task ahead. You don't rush to the bar—you prepare. You visualize the movement. You check your form. You ensure everything is aligned before you even think about adding weight.</p>

<p>Product leadership is no different.</p>

<p>Yet every day, I see teams rushing to build features before they've established their foundation. They're adding weight to the bar before they've mastered the movement. They're optimizing metrics before they've defined their mission.</p>

<p>This is the first and most critical mistake in product leadership: putting metrics before mission.</p>`

      content: `<p>Here's what I see happening in product teams across the industry:</p>

<blockquote>A product manager joins a team. They're immediately bombarded with dashboards, conversion rates, user acquisition costs, and retention metrics. Within their first week, they're being asked to improve some number by some percentage. The mission statement? It's buried somewhere in a company wiki, written by the marketing team, and about as inspiring as reading assembly instructions.</blockquote>

<p>This is backwards. And it's dangerous.</p>

<p>When you start with metrics, you're essentially loading the bar before you've learned proper form. You might see some initial gains—hell, you might even hit a few personal records—but eventually, you're going to get injured. Or worse, you're going to plateau, stuck lifting the same weight for years because you never built the foundation to progress.</p>

<p>In powerlifting, we call this "ego lifting." It's when someone loads up the bar with more weight than they can handle with proper form, just to hit a number. It looks impressive for a moment, but it's not sustainable. It's not real strength.</p>

<p>The same thing happens in product. Teams optimize for vanity metrics. They celebrate hitting user acquisition targets while their core users are churning. They focus on increasing engagement time while the product becomes more addictive and less valuable. They ship features that move numbers but don't move the mission forward.</p>`

      title: "What Mission Really Means",
      content: `<p>Let's be clear about what I mean by mission. I'm not talking about corporate mission statements. Those beautifully crafted paragraphs that sound like they were written by a committee of consultants and approved by legal. I'm talking about something deeper, more personal, more actionable.</p>

<p>Your mission is your "why." It's the reason you show up to work every day. It's the problem you're solving, the people you're serving, the change you're trying to create in the world.</p>

<p>In powerlifting, my mission isn't to lift heavy weights. That's just the metric. My mission is to build unshakeable mental resilience, to prove to myself that I can overcome any challenge, to develop the discipline that carries over into every other area of my life.</p>

<p>The heavy weights are just how I measure my progress toward that mission.</p>

<p>In product, your mission isn't to increase user engagement or reduce churn or improve conversion rates. Those are metrics. Your mission is to solve a real problem for real people. To make their lives better, easier, more fulfilling. To create value that didn't exist before.</p>

<p>The metrics are just how you measure your progress toward that mission.</p>`

      title: "How Metrics Without Mission Fail",
      content: `<p>When you lead with metrics instead of mission, several things go wrong:</p>

<h3>1. You Optimize for the Wrong Things</h3>
<p>Metrics without context are meaningless. Increasing user engagement sounds good until you realize you're just making your product more addictive. Growing your user base sounds great until you discover you're attracting the wrong users who will never find real value in what you're building.</p>

<h3>2. You Lose Long-term Perspective</h3>
<p>Metrics are inherently short-term. They tell you what happened last week, last month, last quarter. But missions are long-term. They're about where you want to be in five years, ten years, or beyond. When you optimize for metrics alone, you sacrifice long-term value for short-term gains.</p>

<h3>3. You Create Misaligned Incentives</h3>
<p>When teams are measured purely on metrics, they'll find ways to game those metrics. This isn't because people are bad—it's because they're human. If you tell someone their performance review depends on increasing daily active users, they'll find ways to increase daily active users, even if those methods don't actually create value for the users or the business.</p>

<h3>4. You Build Features, Not Products</h3>
<p>Without a clear mission, product development becomes a series of disconnected feature releases. You're not building toward something cohesive; you're just adding more weight to the bar without improving your form. The result is a bloated product that does a lot of things poorly instead of a focused product that solves one problem exceptionally well.</p>`

      id: "mission-driven-metrics",
      title: "Mission-Driven Metrics",
      content: `<p>This doesn't mean metrics don't matter. They absolutely do. But they need to serve your mission, not drive it.</p>

<p>When your mission is clear, choosing the right metrics becomes obvious. If your mission is to help people manage their finances better, you don't just measure app opens—you measure whether people are actually saving more money, paying down debt, or building wealth. If your mission is to connect people with meaningful relationships, you don't just measure matches—you measure long-term relationship satisfaction.</p>

<p>Here's how to think about it:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mission defines what success looks like</strong> - What change are you trying to create in the world?</li>
<li><strong>Metrics measure your progress toward that success</strong> - How will you know you're getting closer to your mission?</li>
<li><strong>Features are experiments in service of the mission</strong> - What can we build to help us achieve our mission more effectively?</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the proper hierarchy. Mission at the top, metrics in the middle, features at the bottom. When you flip this pyramid upside down—when you start with features or metrics and hope they'll somehow add up to a mission—you end up with products that feel hollow, teams that feel directionless, and users who feel like they're being manipulated rather than served.</p>`

      id: "the-discipline-of-mission-first",
      title: "The Discipline of Mission-First",
      content: `<p>Leading with mission requires discipline. It's harder than leading with metrics because mission is often less clear, less immediate, and less measurable in the short term.</p>

<p>It's like the difference between ego lifting and proper progressive overload in powerlifting. Ego lifting gives you immediate gratification—you get to put big numbers on your Instagram story. But progressive overload requires patience. You start with weights that feel almost insultingly light. You focus on perfect form. You add weight slowly, systematically, over months and years.</p>

<p>It's not as immediately exciting, but it's how you build real, lasting strength.</p>

<p>Mission-first product leadership is the same. It requires you to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Say no to metrics that don't serve your mission</strong> - Even if they're easy to improve</li>
<li><strong>Invest in research and understanding before building</strong> - Even if it slows down your development cycle</li>
<li><strong>Make decisions based on long-term value</strong> - Even if they hurt short-term metrics</li>
<li><strong>Communicate the "why" behind every decision</strong> - Even if it takes more time and effort</li>
</ul>

<p>This discipline is what separates good product leaders from great ones. Anyone can optimize a metric. It takes real leadership to stay true to a mission when the metrics are telling you to go in a different direction.</p>`

      title: "Starting Your Mission-First Journey",
      content: `<p>If you're reading this and realizing you've been putting metrics before mission, don't panic. This isn't about throwing out your entire product strategy and starting over. It's about reframing what you're already doing through the lens of mission.</p>

<p>Start here:</p>

<h3>1. Define Your Mission (If You Haven't Already)</h3>
<p>What problem are you solving? For whom? Why does it matter? Your mission should be simple enough to remember, specific enough to guide decisions, and meaningful enough to inspire action.</p>

<h3>2. Audit Your Current Metrics</h3>
<p>Look at every metric you're currently tracking and ask: "Does this help us understand our progress toward our mission?" If the answer is no, stop tracking it. If the answer is yes, keep it but reframe how you think about it.</p>

<h3>3. Align Your Features</h3>
<p>For every feature on your roadmap, ask: "How does this serve our mission?" If you can't answer that question clearly, either reframe the feature or remove it from the roadmap.</p>

<h3>4. Communicate the Mission</h3>
<p>Your team needs to understand not just what you're building, but why you're building it. Every product requirement, every design decision, every engineering choice should tie back to the mission.</p>

<p>Remember: your mission isn't something you achieve once and then move on from. It's something you work toward continuously, using metrics to measure your progress and features to accelerate your journey.</p>

<p>In powerlifting, I never "complete" my mission of building mental resilience. Every workout is another step toward that goal. Some days I feel strong, some days I struggle, but the mission remains constant.</p>

<p>Your product mission should be the same—a north star that guides every decision, every feature, every metric you choose to care about.</p>

<p>Because at the end of the day, metrics will change. Technologies will evolve. Market conditions will shift. But a strong mission—like proper form in powerlifting—will serve you well no matter what challenges you face.</p>`
