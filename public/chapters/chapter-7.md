# Work Capacity Over Window Dressing

There’s a difference between looking strong and being strong. You see it in the gym all the time: the lifter who chases their one-rep max every week, treating PRs like progress reports. Impressive — until the plateaus hit or the pain sets in. What you don’t see as often is the lifter dragging a sled after squats. Doing walking lunges in the cold. Rowing in the morning and hitting their accessories at night. That’s the engine work. That’s capacity.

> “If you want to go far, build the lungs before the legs.”

In the training world, this is called **GPP — General Physical Preparedness**. It’s not just a warmup or conditioning. It’s the foundation for everything else.

GPP improves recovery between sets and sessions. It builds joint integrity, tissue resilience, and work tolerance. It makes your system ready — ready to train harder, recover faster, and adapt more consistently. And yet, in many strength circles, it’s dismissed. You'll hear things like:

- “Combo sets are my cardio.”
- “I don’t have time for fluff — just the main lifts.”
- “If it doesn’t add pounds to the bar, it’s a distraction.”

That’s the specialization trap. And it’s seductive.

Specialized programs promise fast results. They’re targeted. Efficient. And if you're new to lifting — or building a product — specialization feels like the smart move. Just do the thing you want to improve, and do more of it.

Until it stops working.

Until your joints hurt. Your energy fades. Your momentum disappears. And more than that — you burn out.

Because repetition without variation isn’t just physically risky — it’s psychologically draining. The mind, like the body, thrives on challenge and change. Without variation, even the most disciplined lifter starts dreading the next workout. Even the most motivated developer begins to disengage.

We’ve seen this in teams that only work on performance. Or only ship new features. The work becomes mechanical. Morale suffers. Curiosity fades. They’re strong in one motion — but brittle under real-world load.

That’s why smart teams — and smart lifters — build in variation. Like the **6–2 cycle** popularized by Basecamp: six weeks of deep, focused product work followed by two weeks of cooldown — space for maintenance, reflection, and system health. It’s not a break. It’s capacity training. A rhythm we explored in **Chapter 6: The Mission Demands Recovery**, in the section titled Basecamp’s Built-In Cooldown — and one that other companies have since adopted and evolved because it works.

> GPP isn’t glamorous. But it’s what lets you train hard — and show up strong — again tomorrow.

That’s what Alex Viada understood. A biomedical engineer and hybrid athlete, Viada rejected the false binary between strength and endurance. He trained for both — and thrived. While most lifters feared that conditioning would eat their gains, Viada built an aerobic base robust enough to support heavy squats and sub-5:00 miles. His results weren’t just impressive — they were repeatable. Durable.

You see the same principle in product teams. Linear didn’t try to dazzle with a full feature suite out of the gate. Instead, they trained their engine: performance. Every click, every transition, every load state was built to feel instant — even offline. That invisible investment became their advantage. Users stayed focused, fast, and frictionless. And while competitors stacked features, Linear scaled loyalty.

But the obsession with output can take an even darker turn — in the gym and in the market.

Some lifters now chase not even performance, but the appearance of performance. Injections like **synthol** or site-enhancing oils artificially inflate muscle volume — biceps, shoulders, traps — to create the illusion of strength. No increased output. No increase in health. Just ballooned tissue under the skin. These are vanity muscles, pure and simple. And in too many cases, they don’t just harm the lifter’s reputation — they destroy their body. Heart failure. Sepsis. Amputation. Even death.

> When looking strong matters more than being strong, the mission is already lost.

And in product? It’s not so different. Teams inject vanity metrics into their roadmaps: flashy dashboards no one uses. AI features for the pitch deck. Slideware that outpaces software. It might look good in the moment — but behind the scenes, the engine’s breaking down.

You can’t fake work capacity. You can fake a feature. You can fake a max lift. But you can’t fake the foundation.

Burnout is what happens when you try to specialize your way out of exhaustion. Capacity is what happens when you train for the long haul.

The ones who last don’t just train the output. They train the system behind the output.

# Internal Strength for External Load

Strength isn’t just about what you can lift. It’s about what you can *withstand*.

Anyone can show up strong once. But the mission demands more than that. It demands repeatability. Resilience. The ability to show up strong again and again, under pressure, under uncertainty, under load.

That kind of strength doesn’t come from testing yourself every day. It comes from building yourself for the test — from the inside out.

We know this intuitively in lifting. If you neglect your stabilizers, your joints, your breath control, your bracing — it doesn’t matter what your numbers look like. You’ll break. The biggest total in the gym means nothing if your back gives out the next week. True strength isn’t just output. It’s the integrity of the system supporting it.

> The best lifters don’t chase the max. They train the margin.

That’s what Amanda Lawrence understands. A multi-time world champion powerlifter, Amanda is famous not just for her records — squatting over 600 pounds raw at 84kg — but for her poise under pressure. She lifts with precision, with control, and with composure. And that’s not an accident.

Amanda has spoken about how she visualizes every meet lift weeks in advance. She rehearses the rituals. She manages recovery like a professional sport. She doesn’t just train her muscles. She trains her nervous system, her mental process, her ability to stay composed under load.

That internal strength — not just quad size or grip — is what lets her hit massive lifts on the world stage, even when the bar bends and the cameras are rolling.

## They trained the tendons of the product, not just the muscle.

The same applies in product.

Notion wasn’t always a darling. In 2015, they were nearly dead. No traction. Technical debt piling up. The team had two choices: patch the pain and push forward, or stop, go dark, and rebuild the core from scratch.

They chose the hard route. Two engineers rewrote the entire editor engine over 18 months. No releases. No hype. Just deep technical investment in a stronger, more flexible system. They bet that the internal strength of the product — not surface-level features — would determine their long-term viability.

They were right.

That rebuilt core became the foundation for everything that followed: blocks, embeds, team permissions, scalable collaboration. The invisible architecture made possible everything the user eventually saw. What saved Notion wasn’t a sprint. It was a rebuild.

Throughout my career, I’ve seen how scale and stability work is often dismissed as unexciting — not flashy enough for slides, not "pressable" enough for headlines. Some leaders fall into the trap of always needing something new to talk about. Something shippable. Something that demos well.

But that pressure leads to bloated products, incoherent strategies, and worst of all — users who suffer when the product finally gets real-world load. When everything matters most, the engine breaks.

Here’s the truth: capability refinement is not the boring work. It’s the hard work. It’s where the most difficult engineering problems live. It’s where the most intricate, high-stakes user requirements get applied — not in the pitch deck, but in the heat of usage.

Building a reliable core doesn’t mean every startup needs to design for a Fortune 10 on day one. But it does mean they need to carve out time in the roadmap to move deliberately toward that direction. They need to ask the hard questions early — not just “What are we building?” but “Who are we building it for?” And just as critically: “Who are we not building it for?”

You cannot build for every user in every vertical in every geo all at once. Trying to do so leads to brittle systems and vague products that serve no one well.

As we said in earlier chapters: **laser focus is strength**. Define your product requirements. Define your user. Define the scale. Define your edge cases and your tests. Then do the work — especially the work that doesn’t make the press release.

Because that’s where real durability comes from. Not the big reveal. The boring reps.

I’ve lived a version of that story myself.

Early at Endgame, after CEO Nate Fick made the difficult but necessary decision to narrow our product portfolio to one core offering, engineering leader Tony Meehan and I found ourselves at a crossroads.

The product we had was powerful. It delivered real results and we had major enterprise deals on the horizon. But the architecture wasn’t built for scale. The team had shown clearly that it wouldn’t hold as we moved into larger opportunities.

We could have coasted. Closed deals. Deferred the hard part.

But we knew that if we built a base of users on that foundation, the eventual transition would be expensive and painful.

So in early 2016, we made the call to rebuild. We moved the frontend to React, implemented a new queueing system with NATS.io, and redesigned how the endpoint agent communicated. All of this had to be done in under six months — alongside new features — for a critical delivery with the U.S. Department of Defense.

It was brutal. Long hours. Hard conversations. Constant doubt.

But participating in that live DoD exercise, watching operators succeed with what we had built, it was clear. The effort had been worth it.

The new architecture held. It scaled. It supported the mission until we joined Elastic in 2019.

> Internal strength isn’t flashy. But it’s what gets you through the weight that would break someone else.

# What Powers You?

**The fastest engines in the world still go nowhere without fuel.**

You can have world-class systems, perfect technique, and an unbreakable schedule. But without something driving you — a reason to push through when it's hard, a mission that makes the effort matter — the engine stalls. Strength without fuel is just potential. It goes nowhere.

This is the third layer of performance. After physical preparation and mental resilience comes **purpose**. The why behind the work. The force that powers the engine when the load gets heavy and the results are still far away.

You can see this difference on the platform. Some lifters are chasing numbers. Others are lifting for something deeper — to test themselves, to prove something to a younger version of who they were, or to inspire someone watching from the crowd. The same weight moves differently depending on what’s driving it.

The same is true in product work.

Teams that ship the fastest aren’t just well-organized. They’re aligned around a purpose they care about. They understand the mission. They know what their work means to the people who use it. And that makes them more resilient, not just more productive.

> When the fuel runs low, purpose drives on.

Take **Kristy Hawkins**. Before she was a record-breaking powerlifter, she was a biochemical engineer at Genentech. Her story isn’t about switching careers — it’s about doubling down on curiosity and mastery. Whether in a lab or under a barbell, Kristy trains with the same energy source: a relentless drive to understand, improve, and own her progress.

She’s not powered by comparison. She’s powered by process. And that’s what makes her strength sustainable. You don’t win in two domains over decades by accident. You win by building an engine that wants the work.

The same goes for teams. Look at how **Superhuman** built their product. Founder Rahul Vohra didn’t just want to make a faster inbox. He wanted to build the fastest, most delightful email experience ever created. That goal wasn’t vague or corporate. It was clear, obsessive, and emotionally charged.

They didn’t launch until users said they’d be “very disappointed” if they lost the product. That wasn’t marketing polish. It was purpose, measured.

And it gave the team an engine. Every decision — from UI transitions to onboarding flow — was shaped by that internal fire: delight. Clarity. Joy. The result wasn’t just speed. It was focus. The product knew what it was, and the team knew why it mattered.

Capacity is mechanical. Mental strength is adaptive. But purpose is emotional. It’s fuel.

That’s why it matters *what* you’re building strength for.

You can build a massive work capacity and still burn out if you’re not connected to what it’s in service of. You can become mentally tough and still drift if the mission isn’t clear. Even strong people lose their way when they forget why they’re moving in the first place.

The question isn’t just: *Can you go further?* It’s: *Why would you?* That’s the check-in.

Ask any seasoned lifter what keeps them going, and the answers get quieter over time. It’s not the meet. Not the total. It’s that the ritual grounds them. It makes them better. It reminds them of who they are.

Ask a product team what keeps them shipping when everything breaks, and if they’re still smiling, it’s because the mission means something to them. They’ve felt the user’s pain. They’ve seen the real-world impact. They’ve tasted the outcome of building something that matters.

So, what powers you?

Not just when things are working. Not just when people are watching. But when the bar is stuck. When the sprint is a slog. When the road is long and there’s no applause in sight.

That’s the kind of test SERE training is designed for. In the U.S. military’s Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape course, individuals are pushed to their psychological limits — deprived of sleep, isolated, interrogated. It’s not just a test of skill. It’s a test of resolve. Of remembering the mission when the environment is engineered to make you forget.

The ones who endure don’t have better gear or more talent. They have clarity. They know what they’re fighting for.

That’s your fuel. That’s your engine.

That’s the difference between showing up when it’s **easy**, and showing up when it **counts**.
