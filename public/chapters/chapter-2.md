# Chapter 2: Built Through Reps

*Mastery doesn't happen in a moment — it's forged through consistent, intentional repetition.*

## The Boring Path to Excellence

Watch someone squat 500 pounds and it looks explosive, almost effortless. What you don't see are the thousands of reps at 135, 185, 225 — the slow, methodical progression that built the strength and motor patterns that make that impressive lift possible.

The same is true for great products. Instagram looks like an overnight success, but Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger spent months grinding through iterations of Burbn, their original location-based app. They tested features, stripped away complexity, and refined their photo-sharing concept through countless small improvements before landing on what became Instagram.

Excellence is built through reps, not moments of inspiration.

## The Compound Effect of Small Things

In training, it's not the one perfect workout that transforms you — it's the accumulation of hundreds of workouts that were good enough. You show up, you do the work, you progress incrementally. Some days you feel strong, some days you don't, but you keep adding weight to the bar.

Steve Jobs understood this when developing the iPhone. The famous keynote where he unveiled the device made it look like a sudden breakthrough, but the reality was years of iteration on touch interfaces, battery life, and software optimization. Jobs famously practiced that presentation over 100 times, refining every gesture and transition until it appeared effortless.

Most breakthrough products are built the same way — through the compound effect of many small, unsexy improvements that individually seem insignificant but collectively create something transformative.

## Volume vs. Intensity

Powerlifters distinguish between volume (total amount of work) and intensity (how heavy you're lifting relative to your max). Both matter, but they serve different purposes. High-volume phases build work capacity and technique. High-intensity phases test your limits and drive strength gains.

Product development needs the same balance. Most of your work should be moderate-intensity volume — shipping features, fixing bugs, improving user experience, refactoring code. This builds your team's capacity and improves your product's foundation.

But you also need intensity phases — ambitious feature launches, technical architecture overhauls, or aggressive timeline pushes that test what your team is capable of. The mistake is trying to operate at high intensity all the time. That leads to burnout, technical debt, and ultimately slower progress.

The best teams periodize their work like athletes periodize their training.

## The Minimum Effective Dose

Dr. Mike Israetel talks about Minimum Effective Volume (MEV) — the smallest amount of training that produces adaptation. Below this threshold, you're not challenging your muscles enough to grow. Above Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV), you're doing more work than your body can adapt to.

The sweet spot for muscle growth exists between these boundaries, and it's different for every person, muscle group, and phase of training.

Product development has the same dynamics. There's a minimum amount of user feedback, testing, and iteration required to build something useful. Below that threshold, you're shipping features based on assumptions rather than evidence.

But there's also a maximum amount of process, meetings, and analysis your team can handle before it becomes counterproductive. Too much feedback becomes paralysis. Too much testing slows shipping to a crawl.

Finding your team's MEV and MRV is crucial for sustainable progress.

## Progressive Overload Revisited

Chapter 1 introduced progressive overload — gradually increasing challenge to drive adaptation. But the key word is "gradually." Most people try to add too much weight too quickly and plateau or get injured.

The same happens in product development. Teams try to double their shipping velocity overnight, take on projects that are 10x more complex than their previous work, or completely redesign their architecture in one sprint.

Real progressive overload in products looks like:
- Adding one new testing practice per month rather than implementing a complete QA process overnight
- Incrementally reducing technical debt while shipping features rather than stopping everything for a massive refactor
- Gradually expanding team size and complexity rather than hiring 20 engineers at once

The boring truth: sustainable growth happens slowly enough that you barely notice it day-to-day, but fast enough that you're surprised when you look back over months or years.

## The Practice of Fundamentals

Advanced lifters spend significant time on basic movements. They warm up with bodyweight squats, practice form with an empty barbell, and drill mobility patterns that beginners find boring.

This isn't because they need to learn the movements — it's because mastery requires constant attention to fundamentals.

The best software teams do the same thing. They write tests for simple functions. They document obvious code. They review each other's work even when the changes seem trivial. They hold retrospectives to discuss what everyone already knows needs improvement.

This feels inefficient to outsiders, but it's what separates good teams from great ones. The fundamentals compound over time in ways that clever shortcuts never do.

## When Reps Get Boring

There's a phase in every lifter's journey where progress slows down. The linear gains of the first year give way to periods where you're grinding for months to add 10 pounds to your squat. This is when most people quit or start program-hopping, looking for a magic routine that will restore rapid progress.

The experienced lifters know this plateau is where the real work begins. You're no longer getting stronger just by showing up — you need to earn every pound through perfect technique, consistency, and patience.

Product development has the same pattern. Early-stage startups see rapid improvement because everything is broken and easy to fix. Mature products require more sophisticated thinking and longer timelines to create meaningful improvements.

This is where most teams lose their way. They chase silver bullets — new frameworks, different methodologies, complete rewrites — instead of doing the harder work of incremental improvement.

The companies that thrive long-term are the ones that find ways to stay motivated during the boring middle phase where progress is measured in months and years rather than days and weeks.

## The Hidden Work

Olympic weightlifters spend hours practicing technique with empty barbells. To outsiders, this looks like they're not training hard enough. In reality, they're building the motor patterns that allow them to lift incredible weights when it matters.

Most of the work that creates exceptional products is similarly invisible. Code refactoring that makes future features easier to build. Customer interviews that prevent building the wrong thing. Infrastructure improvements that avoid downtime six months later.

This work doesn't show up in sprint demos or quarterly reviews, but it's what separates products that scale gracefully from those that collapse under their own complexity.

## Deliberate Practice vs. Repetition

Not all reps are created equal. Mindlessly going through the motions won't make you stronger — you need deliberate practice that focuses on specific weaknesses and pushes you slightly outside your comfort zone.

The same is true for product development. You can ship features every week, but if you're not learning from user feedback, measuring impact, or improving your process, you're just accumulating work rather than building capability.

Deliberate practice in products means:
- Intentionally tackling slightly harder technical challenges each sprint
- Actively seeking feedback on your worst-performing features
- Measuring user behavior, not just feature adoption
- Retrospecting on failures with the same intensity you celebrate successes

## Building Systems for Consistency

The best lifters don't rely on motivation — they build systems that make showing up easier. They train at the same time each day, prepare their gym bags the night before, and create environmental cues that support their habits.

Similarly, the most successful product teams build systems that make good work inevitable:
- Automated testing that prevents regressions
- Code review processes that catch issues before they ship
- Regular user feedback loops that keep the team aligned with customer needs
- Documentation practices that preserve institutional knowledge

When your systems are solid, individual motivation becomes less important. The work gets done because it's built into how your team operates.

## The Long View

After years of training, experienced lifters develop something beginners don't have: perspective. They know that strength comes in waves, that progress isn't always linear, and that consistency matters more than perfection.

They can spot a beginner who's program-hopping, ego-lifting, or looking for shortcuts. Not because they're judgmental, but because they recognize their former selves.

The same wisdom develops in product teams that stick around long enough. They've seen enough product launches, user feedback cycles, and technical debt accumulation to know what actually matters.

They stop getting excited about every new framework or methodology. They focus on execution over strategy. They optimize for learning over being right.

This perspective is only available through experience — through putting in enough reps to see the patterns.

## Starting Your Rep Count

If you're building a product or leading a team, your rep count starts today. Not with a perfect plan or ideal conditions, but with whatever work is in front of you right now.

Focus on:
- **Consistency over intensity.** Show up every day with moderate effort rather than sporadically with heroic effort.
- **Process over outcomes.** Build systems that make good work more likely rather than relying on individual brilliance.
- **Fundamentals over advanced techniques.** Master the basics before adding complexity.
- **Patience over speed.** Trust that small improvements compound into significant advantages over time.

The rep you do today might not feel meaningful, but it's building toward something larger. The question isn't whether you can lift 500 pounds tomorrow — it's whether you're willing to squat 135 pounds today with perfect form.

Excellence is built through reps. Start counting.
