# Mastery Is Repetition with Feedback

Malcolm Gladwell's now-famous "10,000 Hour Rule," popularized in Outliers, offers a compelling headline: if you do something for 10,000 hours, you'll become world-class. But what's often forgotten — and what Gladwell himself has acknowledged — is that the number only matters if those hours are deliberate, structured, and improving. Not just any reps. The right reps.

You see it clearly in cybersecurity.

Penetration tests are our version of reps under pressure — simulated real-world attacks run across teams, infrastructure, and products. We don't go easy. We don't telegraph the punch. Sometimes, we don't even tell the blue team it's happening. Why? Because defenders don't get warning in the real world. If we want to build muscle memory, we need to simulate the actual weight.

That's what "perfect practice" really means — not pristine, flawless action, but high-quality, high-context repetition. As athletes say: Practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice makes improvements.

It's a mindset that transcends domains. In lifting. In product. In leadership.

## The Lifting Lens: Periodization and Progression

Walk into any well-run gym and you won't just see random workouts scribbled on a whiteboard. You'll see programs. 5/3/1. Texas Method. Juggernaut. Conjugate. Each offers structure, progression, and intentional overload. They're built on periodization — the principle that you can't (and shouldn't) go hard in the same way every day. Instead, you cycle through intensities, movements, and recovery phases. It's not sexy. But it works.

Few have embodied this more successfully than Chad Wesley Smith, founder of Juggernaut Training Systems. A former world-class powerlifter and coach, Smith built JTS into a globally respected platform by emphasizing not just heavy lifting, but smart lifting — rooted in data, long-term programming, and adaptive feedback. As he puts it:

> "Motivation gets you started. Discipline keeps you going. Feedback tells you where to go next."  — Chad Wesley Smith, founder of Juggernaut Training Systems

I use the JuggernautAI app myself — not because it's flashy, but because it delivers structure. It takes in feedback on how I move, how I recover, how I progress — and adjusts the plan accordingly. Every session has a purpose. It's a coach in your pocket, and a powerful reminder that great outcomes come from smart, consistent reps.

And here's the truth lifters learn the hard way: showing up and doing something beats waiting for the perfect plan. A light session with focused movement and intention will outperform a skipped workout every time. Small improvements, made consistently, create compounding strength.

## The Product Mirror: Disciplined Iteration at Elastic

When Elastic Security shipped its initial security analytics and SIEM product in 2019, it wasn't a complete answer to the market. It was a start — informed by users, opinionated in structure, and designed to evolve. What made it successful wasn't just the launch. It was the loop: weekly user feedback, signal from real-world deployments, and disciplined iteration sprints that followed a clear roadmap.

Each product cycle wasn't a shot in the dark. It was a planned lift — part of a broader program of growth. Features like detection rules, case management, and timeline didn't just "appear." They were reps, refined under load. We looked at how users engaged, what didn't click, what needed retraining. We built telemetry into the stack — not to track vanity, but to see where improvement was possible.

## Reps With a Purpose

Whether you're logging lifts or logging bugs, the idea is the same: feedback closes the loop. Reps without it just reinforce habits — good or bad. Reps with it? That's where you find progress.

Athletes track tempo, range, and fatigue. Product teams track usage, drop-off, and latency. Neither discipline rewards brute force for long. But both reward those who show up, take notes, and return better.

In the gym, a lifter might swap from high-bar squats to pause squats to address sticking points. In product, a team might switch to dogfooding an unfinished feature to catch friction early. In both, the rep is the mechanism. The lesson comes from how you interpret it.

# The Grind That Grows

The reps that change you aren't the glamorous ones.

They're not the PR attempts. Not the launch keynotes. Not the LinkedIn flexes. The reps that build real strength — in the gym and in the product — are the ones nobody sees. The early morning warmups. The late-night bug fixes. The process of showing up, adjusting, refining, repeating.

This is *the grind*. And it's where the gains are made.

## In the Gym: Warmups, Not Max Outs

You can spot the novices in any weight room: they go straight for the heaviest lift they can manage. They max out on deadlifts, post it on Instagram, then disappear for weeks.

The ones who stick? They warm up. They move methodically. They hit moderate numbers with perfect form. They log their progress. And they show up again tomorrow.

Warming up isn't a sign of weakness. It's the mark of a seasoned lifter. It's protection. Preparation. And part of the process. As Chad Wesley Smith and countless coaches remind us — progress is built on consistency, not bravado.

## In Product: Quiet Wins That Matter

Product teams can fall into the same trap. We celebrate the big splashy features, but the real loyalty comes from the quiet wins — the "minor" UX updates that shave 10 clicks off a daily workflow. The improved loading time. The default that finally makes sense.

We saw this first-hand at Endgame. Yes, we differentiated on high-end protections like in-memory attack prevention. But the reason our champions stayed engaged wasn't just the cool stuff — it was the continuous improvement in how they used the product. With each release, we delivered smoother experiences and more intuitive workflows. It added up.

The same holds true at Elastic Security. We spent over a year deeply focused on the alert triage experience. We met with analysts. We compiled hundreds of hours of feedback. We made sure everything they needed — context, actionability, next steps — was right at their fingertips. That wasn't a flashy launch. It was grinding. And it paid off.

> Not every enhancement gets a press release. But the users notice — and often celebrate — the small, thoughtful changes more than the big ones.

## What the Grind Teaches

The grind teaches humility. Discipline. Attention to detail. It teaches you to care about the user who files enhancement tickets, not just the buyer who signs the deal. It teaches you to find progress in the seemingly minor.

In product, it's tackling the long list of enhancement requests. In lifting, it's refining your bar path or ankle mobility. Both require you to step away from the spotlight — and into the discipline of reps.

## The Myth of Motivation

The myth is that motivation carries you. The truth? Motivation gets you started. But it won't carry you through the hard sets, the long roadmap, the friction.

What will? Mission. Ritual. Feedback. Community.

We said it in Chapter 1: *their success is your success*. Their mission is your mission. And everything that improves their ability to achieve it — no matter how small — is critical.

The best product managers and lifters don't chase the end state. They chase the process. They fall in love with it. And that's where mastery begins.

## Look Back to See the Gains

Progress is sneaky. When you're in it every day, it's hard to see.

In lifting, that's why we take progress pictures — not for vanity, but for truth. I've had times where I felt stuck, only to look at side-by-side photos and realize I was growing all along.

Same in product.

One of the best presentations I gave at Endgame was a demo showing the same workflow over multiple years. Each version looked small on its own. But side-by-side? It was night and day. Better design. Better defaults. Better detection. That's the power of consistent improvement.

# Change the Phase, Not the Process

Anyone who's followed a good lifting program knows the feeling: what used to work, stops working. You stall. Plateau. Feel stuck.

The worst response? Panic and start over.

The best? Adjust the phase. Keep the process.

In powerlifting, this is where periodization becomes personal. You might deload. Shift focus to speed or hypertrophy. Swap bars or change stance. But you don't throw away your structure — you modify it with purpose.

The same is true in product development. You don't abandon the mission when progress slows. You evolve your strategy. You change the shape of the work.

## Product Example: Scaling for What's Next

Early in Endgame's life, we took an almost nine-month pause on new features to rearchitect the platform for long-term scale and performance. It was a scary bet, and there were plenty of sleepless nights wondering if it was the right call.

But when we brought the new build to a major deployment — and saw the blue team "win" their live training exercise for the first time — we knew it had paid off. Their expertise made it happen. But our new platform and agent helped enable it.

Sometimes, changing the phase means sacrificing momentum now to build leverage for later. That takes guts. But it's part of the process.

## Lifters Adjust, Too 

Smart lifters know when to change gears. That might mean trying a new program — like shifting from 5/3/1 to Juggernaut. Or letting an AI-based plan like JuggernautAI retune based on fatigue and bar speed. Sometimes it means getting a personal coach, or joining a lifter forum to troubleshoot sticking points.

What matters is sticking to the discipline. You're still logging reps. Still progressing with intention. The ritual stays — the phase shifts.

## Set a Goal to Stay Moving

During COVID, lifting alone in my garage, motivation came from an unexpected place: signing up for a powerlifting meet. I wasn't planning to set records. But having a date on the calendar gave me focus.

That meet — and the ones that followed — taught me something else: competition isn't about beating others. It's about beating the weight. And the community is there to help you do just that. Even your "opponents" cheer you on.

The same lesson applies in product.

When you're feeling stuck, talk to your users. Talk to your peers. They'll remind you why you're doing it. And they'll help you find the next rep.

> Even when you change the phase — the load, the format, the plan — your mission stays. Your ritual stays. The growth continues.

# Growth That Holds

There's a difference between strength that shows up… and strength that holds up.

That difference comes from experience. From failure. From learning the hard way.

We saw it earlier in the story of Hafthor Björnsson — the world's strongest man who tore his pec pushing beyond safe limits. He later called it his "biggest mistake" and rebuilt with a smarter plan. The same pattern shows up again and again in high-level lifting. Even Stefi Cohen, one of the most decorated lifters of her generation, has shifted focus toward long-term health, adjusting how she trains, eats, and recovers — not out of fear, but out of wisdom.

These lessons apply everywhere high performance matters.

## Product Example: Build Fast, Learn Faster

At **Endgame**, we learned a critical lesson well before the world-shaking CrowdStrike outage of 2024. We had shipped a powerful capability: the ability to update our machine learning-based malware prevention engine out of cycle from the main product release. It meant our users got faster protection. They didn't have to wait for a full product upgrade.

It was the right feature — but it had an unintended consequence.

During Black Friday at one of our retail customers, an update disrupted point-of-sale systems. Nothing catastrophic. But enough to make an impact.

We fixed it fast. We added guardrails. We changed our rollout process. And we never made the same mistake again. More importantly, we kept the feature — and improved how it worked for the user, at their scale, in their implementation.

We learned that the best product capabilities don't just "work." They hold up.

They account for real-world usage, edge cases, and the 80/20 rule — that 80% of issues will come from 20% of scenarios. And we built resilience into the system because of it.

## The Product Takeaway

Your best ideas may cause friction if they're not paired with empathy.

It's not enough to be right. You need to be reliable.

And the only way to get there is through **reps that test the system**, expose the edges, and give you time to learn and evolve. This is how mature products — and mature lifters — endure.
