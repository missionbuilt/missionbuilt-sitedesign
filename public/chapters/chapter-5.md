# Chapter 5: Progress Isn't Pretty

*It's tempting to chase polished outcomes — but real growth looks messy.*

## The Ugly PR

I remember my first 400-pound deadlift. I'd been chasing it for months, watching the number on my program slowly creep up from 365 to 375 to 385. When I finally loaded four plates on the bar, everything about the lift was wrong.

My setup took forever because my hands were shaking. The bar drifted away from my shins on the way up. My lockout was so slow that my training partner wasn't sure I'd complete it. The bar crashed to the floor afterward because I was too exhausted to control the descent.

It was ugly. But it was 400 pounds, and it was mine.

Six months later, when I could deadlift 400 for clean doubles, people watching that original attempt might have said it "didn't count." But they would have been wrong. That ugly, grinding rep was where real strength was built — in the space between what felt comfortable and what felt impossible.

Building great products works the same way. The breakthroughs rarely look like breakthroughs when they're happening. They look like failures, detours, and messy experiments that barely work. The polished outcome you see in demos and case studies comes after months of iterations that would embarrass you to show publicly.

## Missed Lifts and Failed Features

In powerlifting, missed lifts aren't failures — they're data points. They tell you where your current limits are, what broke down under pressure, and what to work on next. A missed deadlift at 405 tells you more about your actual strength than a successful lift at 385.

The same principle applies to product development, but most teams treat failed features like actual failures rather than learning opportunities. They hide them, make excuses for them, or pretend they never happened.

The best teams I've worked with do the opposite. They celebrate intelligent failures — attempts that pushed beyond the team's current capabilities and generated useful information about what doesn't work.

Elastic's SIEM solution started as a series of failed attempts to build security products. Each attempt taught them something about what security teams actually needed versus what the engineers thought they needed. The "failures" weren't mistakes — they were necessary steps toward building something that actually solved real problems.

## The Soreness Principle

After a hard training session, you're sore. Not injured-sore, but adaptation-sore. Your muscles are rebuilding themselves stronger than they were before. The soreness is evidence that you pushed beyond your previous capacity.

Product development has the same dynamic. After shipping a challenging feature or surviving a difficult project, your team feels mentally exhausted. You've stretched your technical capabilities, your process understanding, and your collaboration skills beyond their previous limits.

This exhaustion isn't a sign of poor planning — it's evidence of growth. Teams that never feel this kind of tired aren't pushing themselves hard enough to improve.

But just like physical training, there's a difference between productive stress and destructive stress. Good soreness comes from progressive overload applied thoughtfully. Bad soreness comes from doing too much too fast without proper preparation.

The key is learning to distinguish between them and adjusting your approach accordingly.

## Adaptation Over Perfection

Hafthor Björnsson, the former World's Strongest Man, talks about how he had to completely rebuild his training approach after a serious pec injury. What he thought was a minor tweak turned into a major setback that forced him to reconsider everything about how he approached heavy lifting.

Instead of trying to return to his old methods, he developed new training protocols that emphasized injury prevention and sustainability over pure strength. The result was a longer, more successful career than if he'd just tried to push through the injury.

Product teams face similar inflection points. A major outage, a missed deadline, or user feedback that invalidates your core assumptions can feel like failure. But these moments often force adaptations that make the product stronger in the long run.

The teams that emerge stronger from setbacks are the ones that adapt their approach rather than just trying harder with the same methods.

## The Messy Middle

Every training program has a messy middle — weeks where you feel weaker than when you started, where the weights feel heavier than they should, where you question whether the program is working. Beginners panic during this phase and switch programs. Experienced lifters know it's part of the process.

Dr. Stefi Cohen calls this the "adaptation lag." Your body is adapting to new training stimuli, but the adaptations aren't fully realized yet. You're temporarily weaker because you're in the process of becoming stronger.

Product development has the same pattern. There's always a period after starting a new feature, refactoring a system, or changing a process where things feel worse before they feel better. The new code is buggy, the team is confused, and progress feels slower than before.

Most teams abandon changes during this messy middle, but that's exactly when persistence matters most. The benefits of good decisions often take time to manifest, while the costs are immediate and obvious.

## Intelligent Failure vs. Preventable Failure

Not all failures are created equal. In training, there's a difference between missing a lift because you attempted something at the edge of your capabilities (intelligent failure) and missing a lift because you skipped your warmup (preventable failure).

The same distinction applies to product development:

**Intelligent failures** come from pushing the boundaries of what your team can deliver, trying new approaches to difficult problems, or betting on user needs that turn out to be wrong. These failures generate valuable information and expand your capabilities.

**Preventable failures** come from skipping basic practices like testing, code review, or user research. These failures don't teach you anything useful and often could have been avoided with existing knowledge.

The goal isn't to eliminate all failure — it's to maximize intelligent failures while minimizing preventable ones.

## The Compound Effect of Small Improvements

Malcolm Gladwell's "10,000 hour rule" gets misinterpreted frequently. The original research wasn't about just putting in time — it was about deliberate practice that systematically addresses weaknesses and expands capabilities.

In training, this looks like identifying the specific muscle groups, movement patterns, or energy systems that are limiting your performance, then targeting them with specific exercises. A 2% improvement in five different areas compounds into a 10% overall improvement.

Product development works the same way. Instead of looking for the one big change that will transform your product, focus on systematic improvements across multiple dimensions:

- User research that's 2% more accurate
- Code that's 2% more maintainable  
- Testing that's 2% more comprehensive
- Team communication that's 2% clearer
- Deploy processes that are 2% more reliable

These small improvements compound over months and years into products that feel dramatically better than competitors who focused on individual breakthroughs.

## Learning from Elite Adaptation

The strongest people in the world didn't get there by following a single program perfectly. They got there by constantly adapting their approach based on what they learned about their bodies, their recovery capacity, and their response to different training stimuli.

Juggernaut Training Systems built their success around this principle. Instead of prescribing fixed programs, they created systems that adapt based on athlete feedback. Feeling tired? The program automatically adjusts volume. Crushing your lifts? It increases intensity appropriately.

The best product teams operate similarly. They build systems for learning and adaptation rather than just systems for execution. They measure user behavior, system performance, and team velocity not just to track progress but to inform decisions about what to change.

## The CrowdStrike Lesson

The 2024 CrowdStrike global outage was a perfect example of how preventable failures can cascade into massive problems. A single bad update brought down airlines, hospitals, and financial systems worldwide because the company's deployment process didn't have adequate safeguards.

But here's what's interesting: the root cause wasn't technical complexity or impossible edge cases. It was the absence of basic safety measures that the industry has known about for decades. Gradual rollouts, automated testing, and rollback procedures could have prevented or limited the damage.

This highlights the difference between impressive technical features and boring technical excellence. CrowdStrike had sophisticated threat detection capabilities, but they failed at the fundamentals of safe software deployment.

The lesson for product teams: master the basics before attempting advanced techniques. Your users care more about reliability than cleverness.

## Embracing the Ugly Phase

Every significant improvement goes through an ugly phase where things temporarily get worse:

- Refactoring code makes the codebase temporarily more complex before it becomes simpler
- Changing team processes creates confusion before it creates clarity  
- Learning new frameworks makes you temporarily less productive before making you more capable
- Gathering more user feedback temporarily reveals more problems before helping you solve them

Teams that understand this pattern can push through the ugly phase to reach the benefits on the other side. Teams that don't understand it panic and revert to old approaches just when the new approach is about to pay off.

## Building Anti-Fragile Systems

Nassim Taleb writes about anti-fragility — systems that get stronger when stressed rather than weaker. Muscles work this way: stress them appropriately, and they adapt to become stronger. Stress them too much or too little, and they become weaker.

The best products and teams are anti-fragile. They use failures, user complaints, and system outages as opportunities to become more robust. Every problem becomes a chance to build better monitoring, clearer processes, or more resilient architecture.

But this only works if you have systems in place to learn from stress rather than just survive it. Anti-fragility requires intentional reflection and adaptation, not just resilience.

## Progress Metrics That Matter

Most teams measure the wrong things. They track velocity (how fast they're shipping), but not learning velocity (how fast they're getting smarter). They measure feature adoption, but not user problem resolution. They track uptime, but not user confidence.

Better metrics focus on adaptation and capability building:

- How quickly can you go from idea to validated learning?
- How much do you improve your error rate each quarter?
- How often do you successfully predict user behavior?
- How fast can you recover from different types of failures?

These metrics capture whether you're getting stronger, not just whether you're moving fast.

## Starting Messy

If you're building a product or leading a team, embrace the messy nature of real progress:

**Ship something imperfect** rather than waiting for the perfect solution. Real user feedback beats theoretical perfection every time.

**Run experiments that might fail** rather than only testing safe hypotheses. The biggest learning comes from attempting things at the edge of your capabilities.

**Address one fundamental weakness** rather than trying to improve everything at once. Deep progress in one area compounds better than shallow progress in many areas.

**Document your failures** as thoroughly as your successes. Failed experiments contain more useful information than successful ones, but only if you take time to understand what went wrong.

**Celebrate adaptation** as much as achievement. Teams that get better at getting better ultimately outperform teams that are just trying to execute faster.

Progress isn't pretty. It's messy, exhausting, and often embarrassing in the moment. But it's the only path to building something that matters.

The PR you miss today teaches you how to hit the one you attempt next month. The feature that fails teaches you what users actually need. The process that breaks teaches you how to build more resilient systems.

Embrace the mess. That's where strength is built.
