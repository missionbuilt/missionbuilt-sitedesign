# Chapter 4: Find Your Training Partners

*Iron sharpens iron, and great products are built by great teams.*

## The Spotter's Paradox

There's something counterintuitive about good spotting in the gym. A great spotter doesn't just stand there ready to help — they make you stronger by their presence alone. Knowing someone has your back lets you push closer to your limits. You attempt weights that would feel impossible if you were lifting alone.

But here's the paradox: the best spotters rarely have to touch the bar. Their value isn't in doing the work for you — it's in creating the conditions where you can do work you didn't think was possible.

Building great products works the same way. The best teams don't just divide up tasks and work in isolation. They create an environment where individual contributors can push beyond what they thought they were capable of because they know their teammates have their back.

## Training Solo vs. Training Together

I've lifted alone and I've lifted with partners. Both have their place, but the math is undeniable: I'm stronger when I train with people who challenge me.

Solo lifting is perfect for building discipline, working on technique, and grinding through the boring middle sets. You move at your own pace, focus on your own weaknesses, and don't have to coordinate with anyone else's schedule.

But when it's time to test your limits — to attempt a PR or push through a plateau — training partners make the difference. They see things you miss. They push you when you want to quit. They celebrate your wins and help you learn from your misses.

Software development follows the same pattern. Individual work is essential for deep thinking, complex problem-solving, and building features that require sustained focus. But the breakthrough moments — architectural decisions, debugging complex issues, or shipping critical features — happen more reliably when you have the right people around you.

## The Iron Law of Training Partners

Not everyone makes a good training partner. Some people push too hard and create injury risk. Others coddle you and prevent real growth. The best training partners operate by what I call the Iron Law: they care more about your long-term progress than your short-term comfort.

This means they'll call out dangerous form even when you're excited about hitting a PR. They'll suggest deload weeks when you're grinding yourself into the ground. They'll celebrate your wins but also help you stay honest about your weaknesses.

In product teams, this translates to people who:
- Point out potential architectural problems before they become critical issues
- Ask hard questions about user research when everyone's excited about a clever solution
- Suggest simplifying complex features even when the complexity feels impressive
- Push back on unrealistic timelines even when the pressure is coming from above

The best teammates care more about building something sustainable than shipping something impressive.

## Different Training Partners for Different Goals

Over the years, I've had different types of training partners for different phases of my development:

**The Technique Coach** — Someone more experienced who focused on helping me learn proper form. They prioritized teaching over ego, pointing out flaws in my movement patterns even when it meant using lighter weights.

**The Accountability Partner** — Someone at a similar level who showed up consistently and expected the same from me. We pushed each other to maintain momentum through the boring phases where progress felt slow.

**The Competitive Partner** — Someone whose strength challenged mine. Training with them forced me to attempt weights I wouldn't have tried alone, expanding my sense of what was possible.

**The Supportive Partner** — Someone who encouraged experimentation and helped me work through plateaus without judgment. They created psychological safety for taking risks and learning from failures.

Product teams need the same diversity of perspectives:

**Senior engineers** who prioritize code quality and system design over shipping speed. They catch architectural mistakes before they compound and teach better development practices.

**Peer developers** who maintain consistent standards and hold each other accountable for following team processes. They create momentum through regular collaboration and shared ownership.

**High-performers** whose capabilities expand the team's sense of what's achievable. Working alongside them raises everyone's standards and technical ambitions.

**User advocates** who keep the team focused on real problems rather than clever solutions. They create safety for admitting when features aren't working and pivoting when necessary.

## The Right Kind of Competition

Toxic gym culture celebrates ego lifting — prioritizing how much weight is on the bar over whether you're actually getting stronger. People hide their weaknesses, skip mobility work, and program-hop instead of addressing fundamental issues.

Healthy gym culture celebrates progress — getting stronger, moving better, and building sustainable habits. People share what's working, admit what isn't, and help each other improve over time.

The same dynamics exist in product teams. Toxic teams compete on individual metrics that don't translate to user value: lines of code written, features shipped, or tickets closed. People hide problems, avoid difficult work, and optimize for looking productive rather than being productive.

Healthy teams compete on outcomes that matter: user satisfaction, system reliability, and team velocity. People share context freely, tackle the hardest problems collaboratively, and optimize for collective success rather than individual recognition.

## Creating Psychological Safety for PRs

In powerlifting, attempting a personal record (PR) requires vulnerability. You're pushing into territory where failure is likely. If you're worried about judgment or ridicule, you'll play it safe and never discover your actual limits.

The best training environments create psychological safety for attempting PRs. They normalize failure as part of the process, celebrate effort alongside outcomes, and learn from misses rather than just celebrating hits.

Google's Project Aristotle found that psychological safety was the most important factor in team effectiveness — more important than individual talent, team composition, or resources. Teams where members felt safe to take risks, admit mistakes, and ask questions consistently outperformed those where people felt they had to appear infallible.

In product development, "attempting PRs" looks like:
- Proposing architectural changes that might not work
- Advocating for user research that might invalidate current plans
- Suggesting timeline adjustments when estimates prove wrong
- Admitting when you don't understand requirements or technical concepts

Teams that create safety for these "attempts" discover what they're actually capable of. Teams that punish them plateau at the level of what feels safe rather than what's possible.

## The Wisdom of Training Cycles

Experienced lifters understand periodization — structuring training in cycles that emphasize different adaptations. You might spend 8 weeks building volume and technique, followed by 4 weeks testing strength, followed by a deload week for recovery.

This prevents both burnout and stagnation. Always training at maximum intensity leads to injury. Always training at comfortable intensity leads to plateaus. The variation keeps you progressing while managing fatigue.

Product teams need similar periodization:

**Build phases** where you're shipping features rapidly and learning from user feedback. High output, moderate complexity, focused on momentum.

**Strengthen phases** where you're improving infrastructure, paying down technical debt, and expanding system capabilities. Lower feature output, higher technical complexity, focused on sustainability.

**Test phases** where you're attempting ambitious projects that push the boundaries of what your team can deliver. High risk, high reward, focused on discovering new capabilities.

**Recovery phases** where you're reflecting on processes, updating documentation, and giving the team space to recharge. Lower intensity across all dimensions, focused on learning and improvement.

Most teams get stuck in one mode — usually build or test — and wonder why they're either burning out or stagnating.

## When to Change Training Partners

Not every training relationship lasts forever. People's goals diverge, schedules change, or the dynamic stops being productive. Recognizing when it's time to find new training partners is a crucial skill.

Signs it's time for a change:
- You're consistently compromising your form to keep up with their pace
- They're not challenging you to grow beyond your current capabilities  
- The relationship has become more social than developmental
- You're avoiding certain types of work to prevent judgment or conflict

The same applies to team dynamics. Sometimes you need to switch teams, roles, or even companies to continue growing. This isn't failure — it's recognizing that different phases of development require different environments.

## Building Your Training Network

The strongest lifters don't depend on one training partner — they build networks of people who contribute to their development in different ways. Coaches for technique, partners for motivation, competitors for benchmarking, and mentors for long-term guidance.

Similarly, the most effective product builders cultivate relationships across multiple dimensions:

**Technical mentors** who help you develop better engineering practices and architectural thinking.

**Domain experts** who understand the business context and user needs that should drive technical decisions.

**Process partners** who help you improve at project management, communication, and team coordination.

**Industry connections** who expose you to different approaches and help you benchmark your team's capabilities.

**User advocates** who keep you connected to the real-world impact of your work.

This network might span your current team, other teams in your company, previous colleagues, open source communities, and industry groups. The key is intentionally cultivating relationships that make you better at your craft.

## The Multiplier Effect

The best training partners don't just make you stronger — they make you better at making others stronger. You learn to spot safety issues, provide helpful cues, and create environments where people can push their limits safely.

In product development, this looks like:
- Code reviews that teach better patterns rather than just catching bugs
- Design critiques that help people think more clearly about user needs
- Technical discussions that elevate everyone's understanding of system constraints
- Project retrospectives that help the whole team improve their processes

When you find yourself naturally helping others improve — not because it's your job, but because you want the whole team to succeed — you've developed the mindset that creates exceptional product teams.

## Starting Your Search

If you're looking to find better training partners for product development:

**Be the partner you want to find.** Show up consistently, contribute meaningfully, and prioritize collective success over individual recognition.

**Join communities focused on craft.** Seek out groups that value technical excellence, user-centered design, and sustainable development practices.

**Share your work openly.** Write about problems you're solving, contribute to open source projects, and engage in technical discussions online.

**Ask better questions.** Show curiosity about how other people approach technical challenges, user research, and team coordination.

**Offer help before asking for it.** Look for opportunities to contribute to others' projects, share knowledge, and provide feedback on their work.

The best training partnerships develop organically from mutual respect and shared commitment to improvement. Focus on becoming someone worth training with, and you'll attract the kind of people who will make you stronger.

## The Long Game of Community

Individual strength is impressive, but sustainable strength comes from being part of a community that values continuous improvement. The lifters who stay strong into their 40s, 50s, and beyond aren't the ones who relied purely on natural talent — they're the ones who built networks of people committed to helping each other improve over decades.

The same is true for product builders. The people who create their best work later in their careers aren't necessarily the most naturally gifted — they're the ones who invested in relationships with other people who care about building things that matter.

Find your training partners. Iron sharpens iron, but only when you choose to lift together.
