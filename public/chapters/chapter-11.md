# Listening as Leadership

In lifting, the strongest athletes don’t just follow cues — they seek them out. They crave feedback on form, timing, and control, knowing every correction is a chance to grow. But this hunger for insight doesn’t end at the gym doors. The same mindset defines exceptional leaders: they don’t listen to reply; they listen to understand.

Listening as leadership begins with presence. It’s easy to nod while you plan your response, but transformative listening happens when you quiet your thoughts long enough to hear what the other person truly needs. Whether it’s a training partner describing discomfort under the bar or a teammate raising a concern in a product sprint, the act of listening says: *I value you, and I value what you see*.

Yet we’ve all interacted with someone who claims to want feedback but immediately argues, resists, or shuts down when it’s given. Or worse, those who nod along but only listen so they can seize the next pause in conversation to launch their own point — they’re not hearing; they’re rehearsing their rebuttal. In lifting, these athletes plateau, bomb out in competition, or worse, get hurt chasing weight increases they’re not prepared for. In leadership, the consequences are subtler but just as damaging: a culture where honesty fades, mistakes repeat, and innovation stalls.

When people feel their leadership is unwilling to listen or routinely ignores feedback, they stop engaging. Leadership becomes something to avoid rather than trust. Interactions with managers feel like a tax on progress instead of a path to improvement, and silos begin to form as people retreat to spaces where they feel heard or simply left alone.

Feedback exists for a reason. It’s an outside perspective that reveals what we can’t see ourselves. Day after day, trapped in our own heads, we start to self-reinforce ideas — sometimes bad ones. Without external input, flaws harden into habits.

But feedback must also be given responsibly. Some people weaponize “feedback” as an excuse to be cruel or condescending. Great leaders know that effective feedback is clear, focused on actions — not personal attacks — and delivered with the intent to build, not break. It’s the difference between saying, *“You suck at this,”* and *“You could improve by keeping your elbows tighter during the press.”* One demoralizes; the other empowers.

In previous chapters, we explored how product managers can get lost in tactical execution, missing the bigger picture of the workflow or user journey. The same happens under the bar: you might obsess over your sticking point in a press, never realizing your bar path is drifting forward. Stepping back — and welcoming constructive feedback — is what breaks through these blind spots.

Listening also creates psychological safety — the foundation of high-performance teams. When people know their ideas and fears will be heard without judgment, they stop guarding their words and start sharing the truth. That candor becomes the bedrock of innovation and resilience.

Leaders who listen multiply their perspective. They gain dozens of lenses on the mission. It’s not passive; it’s proactive. They ask clarifying questions. They invite dissent. They recognize that the best solutions rarely come from a single voice — but from many voices shaped into one direction.

And just as a lifter needs to listen to their own body, leaders must listen to themselves. Noticing fatigue, frustration, or ego creeping in is the first step to recalibrating. It’s leadership turned inward: staying aware of the signals that could compromise decisions or derail momentum.

> “Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.” — Stephen R. Covey, educator and author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

It’s also expected that there will be days when you screw up. Not every meeting, Slack message, or email will land perfectly. We’re human. Part of being a great leader is accepting this, taking responsibility for mistakes, and being transparent with your team when it happens. Saying something like, *“Yesterday I didn’t give you enough time to clearly make your point. I’m sorry. Can we continue the conversation?”* shows strength, not weakness.

Just as empathy isn’t a sign of softness, openly identifying your mistakes builds trust and models the behavior you want in your team. Too often, leaders cling to the illusion that they must stay on a pedestal, mistaking authority for respect. These explicit-authority leaders demand deference without earning it, forgetting that respect is given when it’s first shown.

We are all human. Titles are made-up constructs. 

> Be a human, don’t be an asshole, and you’ll be amazed at how well your team can operate.

Listening as leadership is a daily discipline. It demands humility, curiosity, and the courage to act on what you hear — and the wisdom to give feedback that lifts others up, not tears them down. It’s the difference between a leader who demands compliance and one who inspires commitment — and between a team that survives and one that thrives.

# Listening Between the Lines

Good leaders listen to words; great leaders listen beyond them. Because what people say rarely tells the whole story. The subtext — the hesitation in a voice, the glance across a table, the silence after a loaded question — often reveals more about what’s really happening than the words alone.

In lifting, an athlete might claim they’re fine while shifting uncomfortably under the bar. You can hear it in their breath, see it in the wavering setup, or sense it in the way they rack the bar with relief instead of resolve. A coach who misses these cues risks pushing an athlete to injury or letting a lack of confidence fester unaddressed.

In the workplace, the same dynamics unfold. A teammate may say “I’m good with this plan” while their tone flattens or their posture closes off. They might contribute less in meetings, or their messages become shorter and less engaged. These are signals leaders must learn to read, because they’re early warnings of misalignment, burnout, or growing resentment.

Listening between the lines isn’t about mind-reading — it’s about active listening. Active listening is the set of techniques that helps you tune into more than words:

- **Observe nonverbal cues:** Pay attention to body language, facial expressions, eye contact, posture, and gestures. Discomfort, stress, or disagreement often shows up physically before it’s spoken.
- **Reflect and paraphrase:** Repeat back what you heard in your own words. It shows you’re tracking, and it gives the other person a chance to clarify or expand. For example, “So you’re saying the timeline feels tight, but you think it’s still doable?”
- **Ask open-ended questions:** Questions like “How do you feel about this approach?” or “What would you change?” invite honest responses and help surface unspoken concerns.
- **Pause intentionally:** Silence can feel uncomfortable, but giving space after someone speaks often encourages them to share more — especially when they sense you’re patient enough to truly listen.
- **Listen for tone and pace:** Speeding up, slowing down, or changes in pitch can signal anxiety, excitement, or doubt.
- **Eliminate distractions:** Close your laptop, put your phone away, and make eye contact. Active listening demands full presence, and split attention sends the message that what they’re saying isn’t important.

These techniques help you catch the gaps between words and intent, giving you a clearer picture of what your team actually needs.

This kind of listening isn’t theoretical. When Alan Mulally became CEO of Ford in 2006, he started “Business Plan Review” meetings where executives reported on key initiatives with green, yellow, or red indicators. But despite Ford losing billions, everyone initially reported only green. Mulally noticed nervous laughter, fidgeting, and avoidance in the room — clear signs people were afraid to share bad news. He called it out, saying bluntly that with such massive losses, everything couldn’t possibly be green. The next week, an executive finally admitted a major problem by showing a red indicator. Mulally publicly praised the honesty, breaking the culture of fear overnight. By recognizing the disconnect between words and behavior, Mulally changed Ford’s culture, allowed real problems to surface, and helped the company avoid bankruptcy without a government bailout.

A similar lesson comes from the boxing ring. During the 2020 fight between Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury, Wilder’s corner threw in the towel in the seventh round — despite Wilder insisting he wanted to keep fighting. His coach, Mark Breland, saw the subtle signs: Wilder’s legs were unsteady, his reflexes dulled, and his punches lost their snap — clear indicators he was in real danger. Breland’s choice was controversial, but many praised him for protecting Wilder from potentially devastating injury. His willingness to act on what he saw, not just what his fighter said, put the athlete’s long-term health ahead of pride in the moment.

When you can identify misalignment early, you can address it before it grows into conflict or disengagement. When you can spot uncertainty, you can offer clarity. And when you show someone you see beyond their words, you prove you care enough to truly understand them.

# The Ego Lift

Some leaders believe the biggest threat to success comes from the outside — competitors, market shifts, or resource constraints. But often, the greatest danger to a team or organization is internal: an unchecked ego at the top. Ego convinces leaders they alone have the answers, blinds them to new information, and makes them resistant to change. It transforms what should be shared missions into personal crusades, suffocating the creativity and collaboration needed to adapt and excel.

The ego lift shows up when leaders believe their title grants them absolute knowledge or when athletes refuse coaching because they think they know best. These moments look like confidence, but they’re actually insecurity disguised as bravado. And they poison teams faster than almost anything else.

Listening doesn’t work when ego stands in the way. A leader might nod along waiting for their turn to speak, or worse, interrupt to redirect the conversation back to themselves. The effect is the same: people stop sharing. Meetings become performative. Feedback withers. Silos grow. The organization slows down.

This is the dark mirror of what we explored at the end of the last chapter: leaders who claim they alone have the vision and who force alignment through dictation instead of inspiration. They believe respect comes from authority, not credibility. These explicit-authority leaders declare a path without inviting discussion, mistaking fear for alignment. Under their command, teams comply outwardly while disengaging inwardly, working to avoid conflict rather than achieve greatness.

It’s the leadership equivalent of the outdated parenting approach of *“because I said so.”* Modern parents have learned to explain the why behind rules and decisions, recognizing that children are capable of understanding if given the chance. Some claim this is a “weak” way to parent, but those same people often become poor leaders who expect blind obedience like a rigid military hierarchy. Seniority does not always mean smarter. Experience brings valuable insight and intuition, but it is not infallible. Fresh perspectives can break stale patterns, as shown by the famous example of Formula 1 pit crews inspiring hospital surgical teams to improve patient handovers. By admitting they didn’t have all the answers and seeking ideas outside their domain, healthcare teams saved lives because the mission mattered more than their egos.

Leadership is also a constantly evolving role that demands continuous learning and adaptation. *In What Got You Here Won’t Get You There*, Marshall Goldsmith describes how the very traits that once fueled a leader’s success can become blind spots if they fail to grow. Markets change. Requirements shift. What worked in a previous era cannot simply be applied wholesale to new challenges. These past learnings are critical for growth, but they should be treated as guides rather than rigid blueprints.

This challenge is captured perfectly in what’s known as the founder’s dilemma. Founders often excel at the vision, hustle, and risk-taking needed to start a company. But as organizations grow, the same command-and-control habits or unstructured creativity that once fueled early wins can become obstacles. Companies begin to need process, delegation, and collaborative leadership. When founders cling to their old ways, convinced their instincts alone will scale the business, they risk undermining the very mission they set out to achieve. The most successful founders recognize this shift and evolve by seeking mentors, building diverse teams, and accepting that their role must change if they want the company to thrive beyond the startup stage.

When everyone agrees the mission is the most important thing, these decisions become easier. Reaching out for help or inviting alternative viewpoints is the obvious choice when it improves the mission. Those unwilling to listen or unwilling to try usually act from fear and are often motivated by personal agendas rather than collective success. Product management has no place for ladder-climbers or title-chasers. 

> The mission must come first, and when it is your guiding light, every other decision becomes clearer. 

When a team truly cares about the mission, ego fades. And in a satisfying paradox, personal success often follows naturally as a symptom of the mission’s success.

> The hardest lift you will ever make is putting your ego down. 

The strongest teams are led by people who do not let their ego, vanity, or fear get in the way.
