# Don’t Dodge the Heavy Sets

The heaviest sets in the gym teach you what you’re made of. Your technique frays, your breathing shortens, and every fiber of doubt tries to talk you out of the next rep. But if you dodge those sets—if you forever add weight “next time” or cut the range of motion when it gets tough—you never find the limits you’re capable of surpassing.

Like a calendar laid out with intention, the night before a big lift becomes a ritual of mental preparation. Scanning tomorrow’s workout—knowing there’s a 1RM attempt or a set taken to true zero Reps in Reserve—sparks both nerves and excitement. These are the days you celebrate the grind, the day-to-day discipline that built your capacity. The moment the bar bends under load is your chance to prove how far you’ve come. When you finally log that PR in your fitness app, it’s not just a number; it’s evidence of your commitment—and the right to earn a well-deserved deload.

Product work has its heavy sets, too. The planning sessions, the heated debates over priorities, the painstaking designs—all culminate in one make-or-break moment: the release. When the new feature goes live and real users experience your work, it’s the equivalent of stepping onto the platform. The high isn’t just about shipping—it’s the culmination of every rep of preparation, and the point where your investment meets reality.

One of my favorite parts of being in product management is visiting my users. My career has been spent building cybersecurity software, but before that, I was a defender who relied on those very tools to protect my teams. That experience infused me with deep empathy for the difficulty of the job, the importance of effective tools, and a healthy resentment for the snake oil promises that plague our industry.

Every time I step on site at a customer’s Security Operations Center, I get a mini-experience of my old life. For those few hours, I live in their shoes—seeing the threats they face, the urgency they feel, the challenges that keep them awake at night. I love being in the fight with them, brainstorming new ways to integrate with the rest of their stack, and, most of all, witnessing the moment when what we built helps them win. Because when their mission succeeds, it’s proof that every heavy set was worth it. Their mission becomes my mission.

It’s tempting to skip the hard work: to avoid deep discovery with customers, to half-heartedly push a feature to “check the box,” or to let organizational friction excuse mediocrity. But every time we dodge the heavy sets, we trade short-term comfort for long-term weakness. We miss the chance to sharpen our instincts, build resilience, and develop the relationships that make real wins possible.

Like hitting a PR at a competition, seeing a user win with our product feels like hitting my personal best as a product manager. Their success is my lift, and the mission we share is the weight worth carrying. Because the mission doesn’t get lighter. Only you get stronger.

# The Responsibility to Finish

In strength training, a lift isn’t counted until it’s locked out—until control is clear, the bar is steady, and the rep is complete. A squat that’s buried deep but racked before standing tall, or a deadlift that’s ripped off the floor but dropped before lockout, doesn’t earn a place on the scoreboard. The intent doesn’t matter if the execution isn’t finished. The responsibility to finish is about more than effort—it’s about seeing your mission through until the work is undeniable.

The same truth echoes through product management. A brilliant idea or well-laid plan means nothing if it stalls at 90%. Too often, teams sprint through exciting early stages—brainstorming, whiteboarding, the rush of discovery—but lose steam when the grind sets in. The last mile demands relentless focus on details that don’t win applause: validating integrations, testing obscure edge cases, polishing onboarding flows, aligning final documentation, preparing enablement, and ensuring stakeholders are ready. These tasks can feel tedious, but they are the difference between a product that earns trust and one that frustrates users.

One of the most powerful commitments I made to myself came when Endgame joined Elastic. I promised I would never stop advocating for our Endgame users—that I would ensure their mission remained as critical and deeply embedded within Elastic as it was before we joined. To Elastic’s credit, they readily accepted this challenge. Together, we strengthened our platform until our Endgame customers were not only supported, but measurably better protected than ever before. That was the responsibility to finish in action—not letting the work pause at the point of acquisition or integration, but carrying it forward until the promise made to users was fully honored.

When a user buys a product you helped create, they’re placing their trust not just in the brand, but in you. Not every product carries the same stakes—misprinted playing cards might frustrate a game night but won’t bankrupt a family. But in cybersecurity, you’re building your customers’ shield. They rely on your expertise and vigilance to help defend their business, their livelihoods, and the security of the people who depend on them. When you build security tools, you’re shouldering part of that weight alongside them. And if you let the lift drop before lockout—if you stop short of complete, tested, dependable solutions—you leave them exposed.

It’s tempting to skip the hard work: to avoid the late nights of final QA, to brush off corner-case bugs as “edge scenarios,” or to let organizational friction excuse mediocrity. But every time we dodge the heavy sets, we trade short-term comfort for long-term weakness. And in a field where real adversaries wait for missteps, that weakness becomes an open door.

Taking personal responsibility for everything you build is not about perfectionism; it’s about integrity. It’s knowing that when you commit to finishing, you honor the trust your users place in you. Let that trust drive you. Let it fuel you to embrace their mission as your mission. Because what you start may inspire, but what you finish defines you—and only when you lock out the lift does your work count.

# The Lift and the Legacy

And from the outside, both powerlifting and product seem attainable by anyone—and in reality, they are. Both disciplines use muscles we work every day: powerlifting relies on three core lifts that almost anyone who has entered a gym has tried at some point. And product, as we’ve detailed throughout this book, is the art of active listening, the discipline of diligent research and analysis, and the science of prioritization and execution. Anyone can step into either and make an attempt.

However, both require focus and nuance to excel. Minute details like the path of the bar or a user’s non-verbal cues separate the truly elite from everyone else. In lifting, a subtle shift in balance or a half-second of hesitation can mean the difference between a successful PR and a missed attempt. In product, a poorly timed question or a missed signal in a customer conversation can derail alignment or cause you to build something that solves the wrong problem.

The barbell is a teacher of both moments and memories. A heavy lift can change your understanding of what you’re capable of in a single instant, but the deeper value comes from what that lift means over time. The discipline to prepare, the courage to attempt, and the commitment to finish leave a legacy—not just in your personal record books, but in the culture you build around you. Those who watch you lift learn not just about strength, but about character.

In product work, the same legacy unfolds. Our choices ripple beyond immediate wins or losses. The way we engage with teams, the care we put into the final details, the honesty of our conversations with customers—these moments compound into reputations that either build trust or erode it. When you choose to embrace a user’s mission as your own, you send a message: that their success matters, that they are not alone, and that their mission deserves the best you can give.

I’ve found some of my proudest moments in product come not from flashy announcements or big conference stages, but from quiet emails and calls months after release—customers sharing how what we built helped them solve a problem, achieve a goal, or simply feel heard and supported. Those stories remind me that while our work can feel abstract behind code and roadmaps, it becomes real and meaningful in the hands of the people whose lives it touches. Their victories are our legacy.

But legacy can also turn negative if we forget the responsibility we carry. A lift done sloppily in front of new lifters teaches them that form and safety don’t matter. A rushed feature full of bugs teaches a team that deadlines outweigh quality. In both lifting and product, we model behaviors that others will follow. Every shortcut becomes permission for the next person to cut corners; every moment of excellence sets a standard that raises everyone.

The lift and the legacy are inseparable. Every rep you finish, every mission you help complete, contributes to a chain of progress that extends far beyond your time under the bar or your name on the release notes. The hours you spend refining the details, the late nights spent debugging stubborn issues, the patience to listen when it would be easier to assume—these aren’t just tasks; they’re bricks laid in a foundation others will stand on. Your commitment today makes it possible for someone else to rise tomorrow.

Legacy is not built by a single heroic effort. It’s shaped by the consistency of your care—knowing that the lift you grind through today, or the product feature you refine until it sings, becomes part of a culture where people believe in giving a shit because they’ve seen you do it. The real prize of the mission isn’t personal glory; it’s leaving behind a stronger, more resilient team, product, and community than you found. And legacy is also about ensuring everyone—and I mean everyone—has the same opportunity to excel that you have had. It’s about opening doors, sharing knowledge freely, and fighting for a culture where every person has the chance to grow, thrive, and contribute their best.

This is the lift: the act of taking on challenges bigger than yourself, of shouldering weight that matters, of proving what’s possible when preparation meets purpose. And this is the legacy: the stories told by those you helped, the culture of excellence you leave behind, and the quiet confidence that what you built will outlast you and keep serving others.

Legacy is not about ego or credit. It’s about giving your best, every time, so that those who pick up where you leave off are stronger, more prepared, and more inspired to do the same. It’s about treating every decision—big or small—as a chance to show what it looks like to care deeply. It’s about recognizing that while you may stand alone under the bar, no one achieves greatness alone.

When you step back at the end of your mission, whether it’s a lift on the platform or a product release that lands with quiet power, you’ll know the truth: that every rep you finished, every promise you kept, every time you chose the harder right over the easier wrong became part of a legacy worth inheriting. The mission doesn’t end when you’re done - it lives on through those you’ve taught, supported, and inspired.

Own the weight. Finish the lift. And leave a legacy that proves giving a shit works.
