# Spotters Save More Than Reps

Spotters are often seen as the quiet figures standing near the bench or squat rack, but their role is anything but passive. In serious training, a good spotter wears many hats: they are a safety net, ready to intervene if failure would cause harm; a form checker, watching for breakdowns in technique that could lead to injury; and a source of encouragement, offering subtle cues like “tighten up” or “drive through” that sharpen your focus. Yet the essence of a spotter’s job is restraint. They do not lift the weight for you, because doing so robs you of the struggle that creates adaptation. Instead, they give just enough help, if any, to allow you to challenge yourself safely so you build real strength.

> “A spotter’s purpose is to help you lift, not to lift for you.”

This same principle shows up in the best peer reviews. When a teammate reviews your code, design, or plan, they are not there to rewrite your work. Their goal is to provide insights you might have missed, highlight potential risks, and offer alternative perspectives. Done well, a review leaves the author better prepared to own and improve their work, not dependent on the reviewer to fix it. The best peer reviewers, like the best spotters, are vigilant but hands-off until needed.

Similarly, in product work, the feedback we gather from users should act like a spotter’s cues. Engaged users tell us what is confusing, what is delightful, and what is missing, helping us see where to focus. But they do not dictate the solution; they guide our decisions with their lived experience.

> “If we lean too hard on user feedback as a script, we lose our strategic intent. Like a lifter expecting the spotter to lift every rep, we stop growing.”

Even in the boardroom, we do not go in cold. Before an important strategy session or executive presentation, we run our documents by trusted colleagues, seeking their eyes on our narrative, logic, and tone—just like a lifter getting a form check before adding weight. We dry-run meetings to rehearse timing and flow and brainstorm possible questions stakeholders might ask so we can address them confidently. These practices are forms of spotting: they help us anticipate failure points, strengthen our delivery, and ensure we can handle pressure when it counts.

Skipping these spotters by rushing in without preparation or feedback is like dropping the weight in front of your peers. You might overlook a key stakeholder’s concern, fumble a critical metric, or fail to align on goals. By proactively seeking out reviews and dry runs, we build psychological safety for ourselves and our teams, allowing us to take bolder stances and advocate more effectively for our ideas.

> “Remember, the spotter’s goal is the safety and growth of the lifter, not their own performance or recognition.”

The risks of skipping spotters are real, both in the gym and in our work. Attempting a near-max squat without a spotter or safety pins risks catastrophic injury. Likewise, shipping straight to production without a second set of eyes can let bugs, security flaws, or critical oversights slip through. Even when alone, you can set up tools like spotter arms or safety straps in lifting, and automated linters or security scans in software, to catch failures before they cause damage. These tools do not replace human judgment but add a crucial layer of resilience.

This watchful mindset extends to active and adversarial roles like red, blue, and purple team exercises in security. Here, the spotter is not quietly observing but actively challenging the system. Red teams attack assumptions and infrastructure to expose weaknesses. Blue teams defend and shore up vulnerabilities. Purple teams integrate both perspectives to accelerate learning. The spotting role becomes dynamic and strategic, applying deliberate stress so the team grows stronger, smarter, and more resilient before a real adversary arrives.

> “Great spotters know when to speak up, when to stay silent, and how to encourage without undermining.”

To be a better spotter—in the gym, on your team, or in the boardroom—focus on staying attentive, offering clear and timely feedback, and resisting the urge to take over. Remember, you are not there to lift the weight, give the presentation, or write the feature; you are there to assist, protect, and create the conditions for someone else to succeed. As explored earlier, a key aspect of strong product management is defining the why, not prescribing the how, empowering engineering teams to discover innovative solutions rather than trying to do the lift alone. Above all, great spotters listen deeply, because understanding what someone needs in the moment is the difference between helping them grow and accidentally holding them back. And listening, both as a skill and a form of strength, is exactly what we will explore in the next chapter.

# Trust Is a Shared PR

In powerlifting, a personal record, or PR, is celebrated not just by the lifter but by everyone who helped them reach it. Spotters, coaches, training partners—each person who encouraged, corrected form, or simply showed up to support shares in the success. Trust grows strongest in these moments because the lifter knows they could not have done it alone, and the team feels ownership in the accomplishment.

> “A shared PR is a shared story, one that bonds people together and makes them eager to keep showing up for each other.”

In product work, trust is forged the same way. When teams win together—landing a major customer, resolving a critical outage, or shipping a complex feature—the shared achievement becomes a foundation for deeper collaboration.

> “Trust grows not because of individual heroics, but because people see each other invest, struggle, and succeed side by side.”

Shared PRs in the workplace are not just milestones; they are reminders that we are stronger as a team than as individuals.

A personal example comes from working alongside my former engineering peer, Tony Meehan. We had a strict rule when communicating to the team: never use I statements. Our reasoning was simple. There was nothing we accomplished in that job that was done alone, so saying “I did this” or “I fixed that” was incorrect. Everything became “we” or “the team,” even in small wins. We also made it a habit to take blame when things went wrong and defer credit when things went right. This simple discipline created a culture of shared ownership, where trust was built through consistent signals that no one succeeded or failed alone.

This mindset helped us build a world-class endpoint at Endgame by sharing the mission, the credit, and the responsibility with everyone involved. We avoided the false pretense that leaders single-handedly make everything happen. The truth is, we are only as strong as our team. Our real job as leaders is to clear the path for our team’s success, remove obstacles, and ensure everyone can do their best work.

This was the heart of what Nate meant when he said we were an elevator asset company, as shared in the first chapter. Our mission was not to build products for our resumes but to lift others—users, teammates, and the organization—so they could rise higher. Every decision, every feature, every fix was grounded in the belief that we succeed only when we help others succeed first.

When I entered the world of competitive powerlifting, I was intimidated. I was surrounded by people stronger than me, lifting far more than me, and for much longer. I expected to be mocked or ignored because of my starting lifts. But it was the total opposite. The entire community celebrated every lift, no matter the weight, because they were there for the love of growth.

> “True communities of strength do not measure value by the weight on the bar but by the willingness to show up, put in the work, and support each other along the way.”

That experience solidified the fact that real strength lifts others.

The best teams lift the weaknesses of others and amplify their strengths. The best leaders know their own challenges and intentionally build teams that fill those gaps, challenge them, and make everyone better. Abraham Lincoln famously surrounded himself with people who disagreed with him because he understood that true leadership does not fear dissent; it embraces it to sharpen decisions and expand perspectives. Weak leaders hire yes-men and cling to their authority, afraid of being replaced or overshadowed. But greatness comes from wanting your team to be better than you, from helping them grow to surpass what you could achieve alone. That is real leadership: creating an environment where others succeed, thrive, and carry the mission forward stronger than you ever could on your own.

I see the same lesson every time I coach in powerlifting. I help lifters who can move more weight than I ever will, and I love it. There is no jealousy in their success; only pride. Their growth does not diminish me—it fulfills me. That is the joy of building strength in others, of seeing people achieve things they once thought impossible. This is the mindset great leaders carry into every team they build: knowing that their true legacy is not what they personally accomplish, but what they enable others to do.

Yet many organizations unintentionally erode this trust by rewarding only the person who lifts the heaviest—the loudest voice in a meeting or the contributor who works unsustainably long hours. These incorrect rewards extend to structures like executive bonuses tied solely to short-term metrics or exclusive club trips awarded only to individual sales reps. While intended to motivate, they create a culture of isolated effort, where teammates compete for personal recognition instead of collaborating for shared success. It is like a lifter chasing PRs without ever spotting others, focused only on their own numbers while the team stagnates around them.

Building a culture of shared PRs means celebrating contributions at every level: the engineer who asked a critical question in a design review, the product manager who aligned stakeholders, the customer success team that surfaced insights changing the roadmap. When we recognize that each lift, each launch, and each success is the result of collective effort, we shift the spotlight from individual ego to shared mission.

Just as in training, trust grows fastest in tough moments. When mistakes happen or plans fall apart, how a team responds determines whether trust is built or broken. Blame creates distance, but honesty, accountability, and a commitment to move forward together deepen trust and keep the team resilient. Shared PRs are not only about winning but about recovering and learning side by side.

We should remember that celebrating shared successes is not just about recognition; it is about reinforcing the bonds of trust and the belief that everyone’s contribution matters. Leaders who highlight team wins, acknowledge behind-the-scenes work, and remind everyone that no victory is a solo achievement build cultures where people feel seen and valued. When teams feel their efforts are recognized, they invest more deeply in the mission and each other.

I do not believe in the myth of the single person shaping the world. Stories of figures like Musk or Jobs often overlook the teams of brilliant designers, engineers, and product managers who imagined, built, and refined what those leaders presented. Apple’s iconic products were crafted by extraordinary groups whose work was brought to Jobs, not invented solely by him. Musk has made careers out of buying others’ visions and marketing them as his own. Ego has no place in product management. Our role, as I shared often with Tony at Endgame, is to take the blame when things go wrong and defer the credit when things go right.

> “No single person defines a product or a company, and those who claim otherwise have a personal reckoning they need to face.”

Real strength, real leadership, and real success come from recognizing that only by lifting each other do we reach heights worth celebrating.

# The Tool You Invest In

Every lifter knows that your tools matter. Barbells with tight tolerances, smooth bearings, and well-maintained knurling do not just make lifting more enjoyable—they make it safer, more effective, and more consistent. Investing in quality equipment is not about appearances but about performance and longevity. Neglecting your tools leads to unpredictable outcomes, unnecessary risk, and wasted effort.

The same is true in building products and teams. The most important tool you will ever invest in is your people. Yet in too many organizations, especially those led by egocentric founders or executives, the energy and focus go toward building a cult of personality instead of investing in the team that actually delivers results. These leaders chase personal brand moments—keynotes, interviews, social media spotlights—while their people struggle with lack of resources, shifting priorities, and unclear goals. Companies like these are not designed to lift everyone up; they are designed to keep one person at the top.

> WeWork under Adam Neumann is a prime example. Neumann’s obsession with his personal image and extravagant lifestyle overshadowed the needs of the company and its employees. His behavior bred chaos and instability, culminating in WeWork’s spectacular collapse, which hurt thousands of workers and investors who had trusted in the vision of one person rather than a strong team.

I preach the complete opposite. Our role as leaders is not to cultivate an image of ourselves as saviors or visionaries. It is to clear the path so our teams can do their best work, remove obstacles, and set them up for success without making ourselves the story. A leader who needs to be the hero will always sacrifice team health for personal glory. A leader who makes the team the hero builds lasting strength.

> Consider Microsoft under Satya Nadella. By shifting focus away from internal politics and combative silos to a culture of empathy, shared success, and growth mindset, Nadella turned a stagnating giant into one of the world’s most innovative and collaborative companies. His investment in people became Microsoft’s most powerful tool, reigniting both morale and performance.

This investment shows up in simple but powerful ways: regular one-on-one conversations that go beyond status updates, clear career paths that match individual goals with organizational needs, and genuine encouragement when someone steps up to face a tough challenge. Just like oiling the bearings of a barbell or checking the safety pins, these small actions add up to a culture where everyone feels they can perform at their best.

When you fail to invest in your tools, or your team, things break. People leave, quality suffers, and trust erodes. Frustration festers when problems are ignored or when people are treated like cogs rather than craftspeople. Teams become brittle, unable to adapt when stress increases. Over time, just like a neglected piece of gym equipment, they become unsafe and unreliable.

The best leaders recognize that the team itself is the ultimate tool. They make proactive investments in learning opportunities, mentorship, collaboration rituals, and mental health support. They advocate for their team’s needs with the same urgency they would apply to fixing a broken production system. They know that an investment in people pays dividends in creativity, resilience, and sustained performance.

And they remember that this investment is ongoing. Just as a well-used barbell requires regular maintenance, people require consistent care. The strongest teams are not built by one-time efforts or flashy perks but by steady, thoughtful attention that helps every member feel stronger, safer, and more capable.

Empathy is at the heart of great product management. We spend time listening to users, understanding their pain, and building solutions that make their lives better. Yet too many leaders forget that empathy must start with our own teams. The same patience, curiosity, and care we extend to customers should guide how we support those we work with every day. When leaders apply empathy both outward to users and inward to their teams, they create a culture where everyone feels seen, valued, and motivated to do their best work.

> “Titles do not matter. Relying on explicit authority—your rank, your title, your power over someone’s paycheck—reveals weakness, not strength.”

The strongest leaders do not force people to follow them. They create an environment where people want to follow because they trust the mission, believe in the work, and feel supported in becoming their best. This is implicit authority: the quiet confidence earned by consistently empowering others. It is the difference between being a boss people fear and a leader people choose.

I saw this firsthand in the US Army. Those who demanded respect purely through their rank were often the ones who deserved it the least. True leaders like Nate Fick inspired teams who wanted to follow them into battle, not because they had to, but because they believed in the leader, the mission, and each other.

The strongest teams are not defined by the brilliance of a single person but by how fiercely they lift each other, day after day. When we invest in people with patience and purpose, we build not just products, but missions worth believing in.
